        <h4>About</h4>
        LonelyAstronaut95 is stranded far from home. They donâ€™t know any of the surrounding
        civilisations and are too far from home to communicate. Desperate for friendship,
        their only method of interaction with the outside universe is via a social media
        device - using a language that they do not know. LonelyAstronaut95 was developed for Global Game Jam 2018

        <h4>Game Jam Scenario</h4>
        <p>
          This game jam team was half-formed before the day. Being my first game jam, I had no
          idea what to expect. I was thrilled to be the lead programmer in a team that
          successfully completed a playable game in under 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The post-gamejam fixes were minimal, and aimed to deliver a smoother playthrough
          for the Melbourne Play Party, involving a simple, less random planet personality system.
